# geth-08-abigen

**Goal:** use typed contract bindings (abigen-style) for safer calls and transactions.

## Big Picture

abigen turns ABI into typed Go methods. Instead of manual ABI pack/unpack, you get compile-time checked methods with `CallOpts` and `TransactOpts` for read/write. This reduces boilerplate and errors.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how abigen bindings wrap `BoundContract` with typed methods.
- Make typed view calls (name/symbol/decimals/balanceOf).
- See how `CallOpts` and `TransactOpts` carry context, block number, signer info.

## Prerequisites
- Module 07 (manual ABI calls) and Go interfaces.

## Real-World Analogy
- Typed remote control with labeled buttons instead of sending raw opcodes. CPU analogy: using syscall stubs instead of hand-rolled assembly.

## Steps
1. Parse RPC, token address, optional holder.
2. Create binding (generated by abigen in real life; minimal manual binding here).
3. Call typed methods and print results.

## Fun Facts & Comparisons
- `abigen` CLI generates Go bindings from ABI + bin; integrates with `bind.TransactOpts` for txs.
- ethers.js provides similar contract objects but is dynamically typed.
- Bindings still use the same JSON-RPC under the hood; benefit is ergonomics and safety.

- Contract interactions — matches front-end libraries but in Go.
