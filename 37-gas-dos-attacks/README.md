# Project 37: Gas DoS Attacks

A comprehensive educational project demonstrating gas-based denial of service (DoS) attacks in Solidity and their mitigations.

## Overview

Gas DoS attacks exploit the gas mechanics of the Ethereum Virtual Machine to make contracts unusable or significantly degrade their performance. This project explores various DoS attack vectors and teaches secure coding patterns to prevent them.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand unbounded loops and their dangers
- Learn about block gas limit constraints
- Recognize expensive fallback function vulnerabilities
- Understand griefing attacks and economic DoS
- Master push vs pull payment patterns
- Identify msg.sender blocking attacks
- Implement effective mitigation strategies

## DoS Attack Vectors

### 1. Unbounded Loops and Iteration

**Vulnerability:**
Loops that iterate over dynamically-sized arrays can grow beyond the block gas limit, making functions permanently unusable.

**Example:**
```solidity
address[] public participants;

function distributeRewards() public {
    for (uint i = 0; i < participants.length; i++) {
        // Gas cost grows with array size
        payable(participants[i]).transfer(1 ether);
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Function becomes uncallable when array grows too large
- Permanent DoS if no alternative access pattern exists
- Attackers can deliberately add entries to bloat arrays

**Mitigation:**
- Use pull payment patterns instead of push
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Set maximum bounds on loops
- Use mappings with external indexing when appropriate

### 2. Block Gas Limit DoS

**Vulnerability:**
Operations that consume gas proportional to user-controlled data can be forced to exceed the block gas limit.

**Example:**
```solidity
mapping(address => uint) public balances;
address[] public users;

function withdrawAll() public {
    for (uint i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
        if (balances[users[i]] > 0) {
            payable(users[i]).transfer(balances[users[i]]);
        }
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Critical functions become permanently disabled
- Funds can be locked in the contract
- Service degradation as operations become expensive

**Mitigation:**
- Batch processing with user-specified limits
- Pull over push patterns
- Separate state modification from external calls

### 3. Expensive Fallback Functions

**Vulnerability:**
Contracts with expensive fallback/receive functions can cause DoS when they are recipients of transfers.

**Example:**
```solidity
contract ExpensiveFallback {
    uint[] public data;

    receive() external payable {
        // Expensive operation in fallback
        for (uint i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            data.push(i);
        }
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Auctions can't send refunds to previous highest bidder
- Payment distributions fail
- Legitimate transfers revert

**Mitigation:**
- Use pull payment patterns
- Limit gas for external calls with `.call{gas: X}`
- Handle failed transfers gracefully
- Emit events and allow manual withdrawal

### 4. Griefing Attacks

**Vulnerability:**
Attackers can waste gas or cause financial harm without direct benefit, just to disrupt the protocol.

**Example:**
```solidity
function bid() public payable {
    require(msg.value > highestBid);
    // Refund previous bidder - can be griefed
    payable(previousBidder).transfer(previousBid);
    highestBid = msg.value;
}
```

**Impact:**
- Economic damage to protocol users
- Service disruption
- Wasted gas fees
- User frustration leading to protocol abandonment

**Mitigation:**
- Pull payment patterns
- Gas limits on external calls
- Economic incentives against griefing
- Whitelisting or reputation systems

### 5. Push vs Pull Payment Patterns

**Push Pattern (Vulnerable):**
```solidity
function distribute() public {
    for (uint i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
        recipients[i].transfer(amounts[i]); // Can fail
    }
}
```

**Pull Pattern (Safe):**
```solidity
mapping(address => uint) public pendingWithdrawals;

function withdraw() public {
    uint amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];
    pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] = 0;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
```

**Benefits of Pull Pattern:**
- Each user controls their own withdrawal
- One failing transfer doesn't affect others
- Predictable gas costs
- No array iteration needed

### 6. msg.sender Blocking

**Vulnerability:**
Malicious contracts can revert in their fallback function to block operations that depend on sending them funds.

**Example:**
```solidity
contract Auction {
    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid);
        // This can be blocked by current leader
        payable(currentLeader).transfer(previousBid);
        currentLeader = msg.sender;
    }
}

contract MaliciousBlocker {
    receive() external payable {
        revert("I block refunds!");
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Auctions become stuck
- Legitimate users can't participate
- Contract functionality breaks down

**Mitigation:**
- Pull payment patterns
- Graceful handling of failed transfers
- Allow admin override in extreme cases
- Blacklist mechanisms (use carefully)

## Gas Optimization Techniques

### 1. Pagination

```solidity
function processInBatches(uint start, uint end) public {
    require(end <= users.length);
    require(end > start);
    require(end - start <= MAX_BATCH_SIZE);

    for (uint i = start; i < end; i++) {
        // Process users[i]
    }
}
```

### 2. Pull Payments

```solidity
mapping(address => uint) public pendingPayments;

function claim() public {
    uint amount = pendingPayments[msg.sender];
    require(amount > 0);
    pendingPaydrawals[msg.sender] = 0;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
```

### 3. Gas-Limited External Calls

```solidity
(bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount, gas: 2300}("");
if (!success) {
    // Handle failure gracefully
    pendingWithdrawals[recipient] += amount;
    emit WithdrawalFailed(recipient, amount);
}
```

### 4. Bounded Loops

```solidity
uint constant MAX_PARTICIPANTS = 100;

function addParticipant(address user) public {
    require(participants.length < MAX_PARTICIPANTS);
    participants.push(user);
}
```

2. **Always prefer pull over push** for payments and distributions
3. **Limit gas for external calls** to prevent griefing
4. **Implement pagination** for operations over large datasets
5. **Handle external call failures gracefully** - never assume they succeed
6. **Consider economic incentives** that might motivate DoS attacks
7. **Test gas costs** at scale before deployment
8. **Monitor contract state growth** in production

## Common Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Never do this:**
```solidity
// Unbounded loop with external calls
for (uint i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
    users[i].transfer(amounts[i]);
}

// Assuming external calls succeed
payable(user).transfer(amount);
nextOperation(); // This won't run if transfer fails

// No bounds checking
function addUser(address user) public {
    users.push(user); // Can grow infinitely
}
```

✅ **Do this instead:**
```solidity
// Pull payment pattern
mapping(address => uint) public withdrawals;
function withdraw() public {
    uint amount = withdrawals[msg.sender];
    withdrawals[msg.sender] = 0;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}

// Graceful failure handling
(bool success, ) = user.call{value: amount}("");
if (!success) {
    withdrawals[user] += amount;
}

// Bounded growth
require(users.length < MAX_USERS);
users.push(user);
```

## Real-World Examples

### GovernMental (2016)
- Ponzi scheme contract with unbounded loop
- Became unusable when participant array grew too large
- ~1100 ETH locked forever
- Classic example of DoS by block gas limit

### King of the Ether (2016)
- Auction contract using push payments
- Malicious contract could become "king" and refuse payments
- Prevented anyone else from claiming the throne
- Fixed by implementing pull payments

## Gas Analysis

### Unbounded Loop Growth
```
10 participants:   ~50,000 gas
100 participants:  ~500,000 gas
1000 participants: ~5,000,000 gas
2000 participants: Exceeds block limit (30M gas)
```

### Pull vs Push Comparison
```
Push to 100 users:  ~5,000,000 gas (single transaction)
Pull (per user):    ~50,000 gas (100 transactions)
                    Total: ~5,000,000 gas
```

**Key Difference:** Pull pattern distributes gas cost across users and prevents DoS.
