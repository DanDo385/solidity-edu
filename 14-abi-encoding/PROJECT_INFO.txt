KEY LEARNING CONCEPTS:
----------------------
1. ABI Encoding Methods
   - abi.encode (safe, padded)
   - abi.encodePacked (compact, risky)
   - abi.encodeWithSignature
   - abi.encodeWithSelector

2. Function Selectors
   - 4-byte selector calculation
   - Selector collision risks
   - Manual function routing
   - EVM function dispatching

3. Security Vulnerabilities
   - Hash collision attacks
   - Signature replay vulnerabilities
   - encodePacked dangers
   - Safe hashing practices

4. Practical Skills
   - When to use each encoding method
   - Gas optimization with selectors
   - Fallback function routing
   - Low-level call data manipulation

TEST COVERAGE:
--------------
✓ Encoding comparison tests
✓ Hash collision demonstrations
✓ Function selector calculations
✓ Fallback routing validation
✓ Security vulnerability scenarios
✓ Gas usage comparisons
✓ Type encoding comparisons
✓ Real-world attack simulations

EDUCATIONAL FEATURES:
---------------------
- 45 TODO items for hands-on learning
- Extensive inline documentation
- Security warnings throughout
- Real-world vulnerability examples
- Gas optimization tips

- Interactive console demonstrations

USAGE:
------
cd /home/user/solidity-edu/14-abi-encoding
forge test -vvv                    # Run all tests with verbose output
forge test --gas-report            # See gas comparisons
forge test --match-test Collision  # Run collision tests only
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol   # Deploy with demonstrations

ADVANCED TOPICS COVERED:
------------------------
- Birthday paradox and selector collisions
- EIP-712 typed data hashing
- Proxy pattern encoding
- Meta-transaction encoding
- Storage optimization
- Low-level assembly operations

This project provides complete, production-quality educational materials
for understanding ABI encoding and function selectors in Solidity.
