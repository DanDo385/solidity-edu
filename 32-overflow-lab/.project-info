PROJECT 32: INTEGER OVERFLOW LABS (PRE-0.8)
===========================================

Created: 2025-11-15
Solidity Version: ^0.8.20
Framework: Foundry

DESCRIPTION:
Comprehensive educational project teaching integer overflow/underflow 
vulnerabilities that affected Solidity before version 0.8.0. Includes 
real-world exploits (BeautyChain, SMT), SafeMath implementation, and 
modern 0.8+ protections.

FILES CREATED:
  - README.md (539 lines) - Comprehensive learning guide
  - QUICK_START.md (305 lines) - Quick start guide
  - CHEAT_SHEET.md (484 lines) - Quick reference
  - src/Project32.sol (388 lines) - Skeleton with TODOs
  - src/solution/Project32Solution.sol (754 lines) - Complete solution
  - test/Project32.t.sol (702 lines) - Comprehensive tests
  - script/DeployProject32.s.sol (282 lines) - Deployment script

TOTAL: 3,454 lines of educational content

KEY FEATURES:
  ✓ Simulates pre-0.8 behavior with unchecked blocks
  ✓ Complete SafeMath library implementation
  ✓ Real exploit reproductions (BeautyChain, SMT)
  ✓ Safe vs unsafe unchecked patterns
  ✓ Gas optimization examples
  ✓ 30+ comprehensive tests
  ✓ Advanced scenarios (time locks, voting, interest)

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
  1. Understand overflow/underflow mechanics
  2. Study historical exploits and their impact
  3. Implement SafeMath library from scratch
  4. Compare pre-0.8 vs 0.8+ behavior
  5. Learn when unchecked blocks are safe vs dangerous
  6. Master gas optimization techniques

CONTRACTS:
  - VulnerableToken: Simulates pre-0.8 vulnerabilities
  - SafeToken: Uses SafeMath for protection
  - ModernToken: Relies on 0.8+ automatic checks
  - UncheckedExamples: Safe and unsafe patterns
  - AdvancedOverflowScenarios: Complex scenarios

TESTS INCLUDE:
  ✓ Underflow/overflow exploits
  ✓ BeautyChain exploit reproduction
  ✓ SMT exploit reproduction
  ✓ SafeMath protection verification
  ✓ 0.8+ automatic check verification
  ✓ Gas cost comparisons
  ✓ Edge case testing
  ✓ Fuzz testing

USAGE:
  forge test              # Run all tests
  forge test -vvv         # Verbose output
  forge test --gas-report # With gas reporting
