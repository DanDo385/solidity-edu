Key Learning Points:
-------------------
1. call() - Executes in target's context
   - Modifies target's storage
   - msg.sender changes to caller
   - Use for external contract calls

2. delegatecall() - Executes in caller's context
   - Modifies caller's storage (DANGEROUS!)
   - msg.sender preserved
   - Requires exact storage layout matching
   - Use for proxy patterns

3. staticcall() - Read-only execution
   - Reverts on state changes
   - Safe for untrusted contracts
   - Use for view/pure functions

4. Storage Corruption
   - Demonstrates misaligned storage layouts
   - Shows how delegatecall can corrupt storage
   - Provides safe proxy pattern alternative

5. Security Best Practices
   - Always check return values
   - Bubble up errors properly
   - Match storage layouts for delegatecall
   - Use staticcall for untrusted reads
   - Understand gas forwarding (63/64 rule)

Test Coverage:
-------------
- Basic call success/failure
- Value transfers
- Gas limiting
- Error bubbling
- Multiple return values
- Static call enforcement
- Delegate call storage modification
- Storage corruption attacks
- Safe proxy patterns
- Gas forwarding behavior
- Edge cases (EOA, empty calls)
- Fuzz testing

Security Warnings:
-----------------
⚠️  VulnerableProxy is INTENTIONALLY vulnerable
⚠️  MaliciousImplementation demonstrates attacks
⚠️  Never use delegatecall without storage alignment
⚠️  Always check return values from low-level calls
⚠️  Use staticcall for untrusted read operations

Usage:
------
cd 15-low-level-calls
forge test -vvv               # Run all tests with verbose output
forge test --mt test_Storage  # Run storage corruption tests
forge script script/DeployProject15.s.sol # Deploy contracts
