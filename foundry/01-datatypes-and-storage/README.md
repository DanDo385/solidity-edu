## 📁 Project Directory Structure

### Understanding `cache/` and `out/` Directories

When you run `forge build` or `forge test`, Foundry generates two important directories:

#### `cache/` Directory

The `cache/` directory contains Foundry's **compilation cache**:
- **Purpose**: Tracks file metadata to determine what needs recompiling
- **Contents**: `solidity-files-cache.json` - stores modification dates, content hashes, imports, and build artifacts
- **Why it exists**: Speeds up compilation by only recompiling files that changed
- **Should you commit it?**: No - it's auto-generated and project-specific

**Real-world analogy**: Like a library's card catalog - it tracks which books (files) exist and when they were last updated, so the librarian (compiler) knows what needs checking.

#### `out/` Directory

The `out/` directory contains **compiled contract artifacts**:
- **Purpose**: Stores all compilation outputs (bytecode, ABIs, metadata)
- **Structure**: One subdirectory per Solidity file that gets compiled - this includes **everything**:
  - ✅ Your contracts (`DatatypesStorage.sol`)
  - ✅ Your tests (`DatatypesStorage.t.sol`)
  - ✅ Your scripts (`DeployDatatypesStorage.s.sol`)
  - ✅ **All forge-std library files** (`Base.sol`, `Test.sol`, `Script.sol`, `Vm.sol`, `console.sol`, etc.)
  - ✅ **All Std* helper contracts** (`StdAssertions.sol`, `StdChains.sol`, `StdCheats.sol`, `StdStorage.sol`, etc.)
  - ✅ **Interface contracts** (`IMulticall3.sol`)
  - ✅ **Any imported dependencies**

  ```
  out/
  ├── DatatypesStorage.sol/          # Your contract

      └── [hash].json
  ```

- **Why so many subdirectories?**: Foundry compiles **every Solidity file** that your project uses, including all dependencies from `forge-std` and other libraries. Each file gets its own directory with JSON artifacts, even if you didn't write it yourself!
- **What's in each JSON file?**:
  - `bytecode.object`: Deployment bytecode (constructor + contract code)
  - `deployedBytecode.object`: Runtime bytecode (what's stored on-chain)
  - `abi`: Application Binary Interface (function signatures, events, errors)
  - `metadata`: Compiler version, settings, source mappings
- **Should you commit it?**: No - it's auto-generated and can be rebuilt with `forge build`

**Real-world analogy**: Like a factory's finished goods warehouse - each product (contract) gets its own shelf (subdirectory) with all its documentation (JSON artifacts) stored together.

**Why this structure?**:
- **Organization**: Keeps artifacts for each contract separate and easy to find
- **Efficiency**: Only recompiles what changed (using cache)
- **Compatibility**: Standard format that tools (Etherscan, frontends, debuggers) can read
- **Debugging**: Source maps in metadata help debuggers map bytecode back to source code

**Pro tip**: You can extract ABIs for frontend integration:
```bash
# Extract ABI for your contract
cat out/DatatypesStorage.sol/DatatypesStorage.json | jq '.abi' > abi.json
```

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Why Solidity Types Are Strict

**Python**: You can write `x = 42` then reassign `x = "hello"`. Types are dynamic.
**Solidity**: You must declare `uint256 x = 42` and can *never* assign a string to `x`. Types are static and immutable.

**Why?** The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) requires:
- **Deterministic memory layout**: Every node must compute the same storage slots
- **Gas predictability**: Type sizes determine computational costs
- **Security**: Type confusion can lead to vulnerabilities

Think of storage like a *global shipping warehouse*: every package must have the exact same dimensions and aisle number on every forklift (node) so deliveries are reproducible worldwide.

### Storage Slots (256-bit)

Every contract has 2^256 storage slots, each 256 bits (32 bytes):

```
Slot 0: [32 bytes]
Slot 1: [32 bytes]
Slot 2: [32 bytes]
...
```

**Understanding Storage Costs (Gas)**:

- **Cold read (first access)**: ~2,100 gas - like walking into a cold storage warehouse for the first time
- **Warm read (subsequent)**: ~100 gas - lights are already on, you know where the file is
- **Cold write (zero → non-zero)**: ~20,000 gas - creating something from nothing
- **Warm write (non-zero → non-zero)**: ~5,000 gas - updating existing data
- **Memory**: ~3 gas per 32-byte word - like a whiteboard, temporary and cheap

**Compare**: Storage is 100x more expensive than memory! On rollups, calldata is cheaper but storage writes are still pricey because data ultimately posts to Ethereum mainnet.

### Data Locations

In Solidity, **where** your data lives is just as important as **what** type it is:

1. **Storage** (Permanent, Expensive)
   - Like a bank vault: secure, permanent, but costly to access
   - Costs ~20,000 gas for new data, ~5,000 gas for updates

2. **Memory** (Temporary, Cheap)
   - Like RAM: fast, temporary, erased when done
   - Costs ~3 gas per 32-byte word

3. **Calldata** (Read-Only, Cheapest)
   - Like a read-only USB drive: can't modify it, but super cheap to read
   - Most gas-efficient for passing large arrays/strings to functions

```solidity
uint256 public storageVar;  // Lives forever, expensive (~20k gas to write)

function temp(uint256[] memory arr) public {
    // 'arr' is temporary, erased after function exits
    // Costs ~3 gas per word to allocate
}

function readOnly(uint256[] calldata arr) external {
    // 'arr' is read-only from transaction data
    // Cheapest option because no copying happens!
}
```

### Value Types vs Reference Types

**Value Types** (Copied When Assigned):
- Examples: `uint`, `int`, `bool`, `address`, `bytes32`, `enum`
- Work like photocopying a document - independent copies
- Real-world analogy: Like cash - if you give someone a $10 bill, they have their own $10

**Reference Types** (Assigned by Reference):
- Examples: `array`, `struct`, `mapping` (storage only)
- Work like sharing a Google Doc link - multiple variables point to same data
- Critical rule: Data location (`storage`, `memory`, `calldata`) determines if you're working with original or copy
- Real-world analogy: Like a house address - multiple people can have "123 Main St" written down, but there's only one actual house

### Struct Packing

The EVM stores data in slots of exactly 32 bytes. Variables < 32 bytes can share slots if declared consecutively, saving gas!

**Bad Packing** (3 slots):
```solidity
struct BadPacking {
    uint256 a;  // Slot 0: [32 bytes]
    uint8 b;    // Slot 1: [1 byte used, 31 WASTED!]
    uint256 c;  // Slot 2: [32 bytes]
}
```

**Good Packing** (2 slots):
```solidity
struct OptimalPacking {
    uint128 a;  // Slot 0: [16 bytes]
    uint128 c;  // Slot 0: [16 bytes - FITS!]
    uint8 b;    // Slot 1: [1 byte]
}
```

**Gas Savings**: 2 slots vs 3 slots = ~10,000 gas saved per write!

## 📖 Deep Dive: Computer Science First Principles

### Building Your Solidity Foundation

This project introduces fundamental concepts that form the **foundation** of all Solidity development. Every concept you learn here will be referenced and built upon in future projects. Understanding these deeply will make you a more effective smart contract developer.

### The Solidity Type System: Why Strict Typing Matters

**Computer Science Principle**: Type systems exist to catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime, ensuring program correctness before execution.

**Real-World Analogy**: Solidity types are like numbered lockers in a gym. Each locker (variable) has a fixed size (type) and can only hold items that fit exactly. Unlike TypeScript/Go/Rust where storage is flexible, Solidity requires exact sizes because every node on the blockchain must compute the same storage layout.

**Why Solidity is Different**:

Unlike TypeScript/Go/Rust (static typing with inference), Solidity requires explicit types and sizes because the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) needs to:

1. **Calculate exact gas costs at compile time** - Every operation must have predictable gas costs
2. **Determine storage layout deterministically** - Every node must agree on where data is stored
3. **Prevent type confusion attacks** - Mixing types could lead to security vulnerabilities
4. **Enable all nodes to compute identical state** - Consensus requires byte-for-byte agreement

**Language Comparison**:

| Language | Type Declaration | Type Inference | Size Specification |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| TypeScript | `let x: number = 42` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (handled by JS engine) |
| Go | `var x uint256 = 42` | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Platform-dependent |
| Rust | `let x: u256 = 42` | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Target-dependent |
| Solidity | `uint256 x = 42` | ❌ No | ✅ Always fixed 256-bit |

**Foundation Building**: This strict type system underpins everything. In future projects, you'll learn that:
- Type mismatches catch bugs early (Project 02: Functions & Payable)
- Storage layout determines gas costs (Project 06: Mappings, Arrays & Gas)
- Type safety prevents vulnerabilities (Project 05: Errors & Reverts, Project 07: Reentrancy)

### Storage Model Deep Dive: The 256-Bit Word Machine

**Computer Science Principle**: The EVM is a 256-bit word machine. All storage operations work on 256-bit (32-byte) words, following a deterministic slot-based addressing scheme.

**Storage Slots: The Building Blocks**

Every contract has 2^256 storage slots (practically infinite), each exactly 32 bytes (256 bits):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Slot 0: [32 bytes] - number (uint256)  │
│ Slot 1: [32 bytes] - owner (address)   │
│ Slot 2: [32 bytes] - isActive (bool)   │
│ Slot 3: [32 bytes] - data (bytes32)    │
│ Slot 4: [dynamic] - message (string)   │
│ Slot 5: [mapping] - balances           │
│ ...                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How Storage Slot Allocation Works**:

1. **State variables** are allocated sequentially starting at slot 0
2. **Each 32-byte variable** gets its own slot
3. **Smaller variables** can pack together if declared consecutively (struct packing)
4. **Mappings** don't occupy slots directly - their values are calculated: `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(key, slot))`
5. **Arrays** store length in their slot, elements at `keccak256(slot) + index`

**Storage Costs Breakdown**:

| Operation | Gas Cost | When It Happens |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| SSTORE (cold, zero → non-zero) | ~20,000 | First write to a slot |
| SSTORE (warm, non-zero → non-zero) | ~5,000 | Updating existing data |
| SSTORE (non-zero → zero) | ~5,000 + refund | Clearing storage (refund up to ~15,000) |
| SLOAD (cold) | ~2,100 | First read from a slot |
| SLOAD (warm) | ~100 | Subsequent reads |

**Why Cold vs Warm?**: EVM tracks recently accessed storage. "Warm" storage (accessed in current transaction) is cheaper because the node has it in cache. "Cold" storage requires reading from disk/state database.

**Foundation Building**: Understanding storage costs is critical because:
- Every storage operation affects gas costs (all projects)
- Mappings vs arrays storage layout determines efficiency (Project 06)
- Storage patterns impact scalability (Project 50: DeFi Capstone)

### Mappings: The O(1) Key-Value Store

**Computer Science Principle**: Mappings provide O(1) constant-time lookups using hash-based addressing. They're conceptually infinite in size (2^256 possible keys).

**How Mappings Store Data**:

Mappings don't store keys - only values! When you write `balances[address] = amount`, the storage slot is calculated:

```solidity
slot = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(key, mapping_slot))
```

**Example**: For `mapping(address => uint256) public balances` at slot 5:
- Key: `0x1234...5678`
- Slot calculation: `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(0x1234...5678, 5))`
- Value stored at calculated slot

**Mapping Characteristics**:

✅ **Advantages**:
- O(1) access time (constant, regardless of size)
- No iteration needed
- Infinite conceptual size (2^256 possible keys)
- Default values for unset keys (0 for uint, false for bool, etc.)

❌ **Limitations**:
- Cannot iterate over keys (no `.keys()` like Python)
- Cannot get length/size
- Cannot check if key exists (always returns default if unset)

**The Zero Default Mystery**:

One of Solidity's unique features: mappings **always** return a value, even for keys that were never set! This is different from most languages:

- **Python**: Raises `KeyError` if key doesn't exist
- **JavaScript**: Returns `undefined`
- **Solidity**: Returns the type's default value (0 for uint256, false for bool, empty bytes for bytes)

**Why This Design?**:
1. Gas efficiency - no need to check "does key exist?" (saves gas)
2. Safety - no risk of undefined/null errors
3. Predictable behavior - easier to reason about

**The Problem**: You can't distinguish between "never set" and "set to zero":
```solidity
balances[alice] = 0;  // Was it never set, or was it set to 0?
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Separate existence mapping**: `mapping(address => bool) hasDeposited`
2. **Sentinel value**: Reserve 0 for "never set", use 1 wei minimum for "exists"
3. **Accept ambiguity**: If zero means "empty", you might not need to distinguish

**Foundation Building**: Mappings are used everywhere:
- ERC20 token balances (Project 08: ERC20 from Scratch)
- Access control (Project 04: Modifiers & Restrictions)
- Voting systems (Project 39: Governance Attack)
- DeFi protocols (Project 50: DeFi Capstone)

### Arrays: Ordered Collections with Hidden Complexity

**Computer Science Principle**: Arrays provide ordered, iterable collections but require careful bounds checking and gas cost awareness due to linear-time operations.

**How Arrays Are Stored**:

Arrays use a two-part storage system:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Slot N: Length (uint256) - stored value    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Slot keccak256(N) + 0: array[0]            │
│ Slot keccak256(N) + 1: array[1]            │
│ Slot keccak256(N) + 2: array[2]            │
│ ...                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight**: Unlike many languages, Solidity arrays store their length **explicitly** as a uint256 value. This provides:
- O(1) length access (constant time)
- No need to iterate to count elements
- Efficient bounds checking

**Array Operations and Gas Costs**:

| Operation | Gas Cost (warm) | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|------------|-------|
| `push()` | ~10,000 | O(1) | Two storage writes: length + element |
| `pop()` | ~5,000 + refund | O(1) | Decrements length, clears element |
| `array[index]` (read) | ~100 | O(1) | Direct slot calculation |
| `array[index]` (write) | ~5,000 | O(1) | Single storage write |
| Loop through array | ~100 × length | O(n) | Linear gas cost - **DANGEROUS!** |

**The Unbounded Growth Problem (DoS Vulnerability)**:

Arrays can grow forever (theoretically up to 2^256 elements). This creates a **Denial of Service** vulnerability:

```solidity
// Attacker can make array huge
function attack() public {
    for(uint i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        addNumber(i);  // Makes array huge!
    }
}

// Later, this becomes impossible (exceeds block gas limit)
function processAll() public {
    for(uint i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        process(numbers[i]);  // ❌ FAILS if array too large!
    }
}
```

**Defense Strategies**:
1. **Limit array size**: `require(numbers.length < MAX_SIZE)`
2. **Use mappings instead**: O(1) access, no iteration needed
3. **Process off-chain**: Emit events, use indexers for heavy lifting
4. **Use fixed-size arrays**: `uint256[10] fixedNumbers` if max size known

**The Swap-and-Pop Pattern**:

Removing elements from arrays efficiently:

**Naive Approach (O(n), Expensive)**:
```solidity
// Shift everything left - costs O(n) gas
[10, 20, 30, 40] → remove index 1
[10, 30, 40, 0]  // Shifted all elements - expensive!
```

**Swap-and-Pop (O(1), Cheap)**:
```solidity
// Swap with last, then pop - costs O(1) gas
[10, 20, 30, 40] → remove index 1
Step 1: numbers[1] = numbers[3] → [10, 40, 30, 40]
Step 2: numbers.pop() → [10, 40, 30]
// Order changed, but much cheaper!
```

**Trade-off**: Order is not preserved, but gas savings are massive (90% reduction for large arrays).

**Foundation Building**: Arrays are used for:
- Iterable collections (when order matters)
- Token lists (Project 09: ERC721 NFT)
- Participant lists (Project 40: Multisig Wallet)
- **But be careful** - many patterns use mappings + events instead for gas efficiency

### Structs: Custom Types and Packing Optimization

**Computer Science Principle**: Structs group related data together, and careful field ordering enables efficient memory/storage packing, reducing gas costs significantly.

**How Structs Are Stored in Mappings**:

When a struct is stored in a mapping, fields are stored sequentially:

```
Mapping: mapping(address => User) users;
For key 0xABCD...:

Base slot = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(0xABCD..., slot_7))
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ base_slot + 0: wallet (address) - 20 bytes │
│ base_slot + 1: balance (uint256) - 32 bytes│
│ base_slot + 2: isRegistered (bool) - 1 byte│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
Total: 3 storage slots per User struct
```

**Struct Packing Rules**:

1. **Variables pack if total size ≤ 32 bytes** and declared consecutively
2. **Packing ONLY works in structs**, not global state variables
3. **Order matters!** Solidity doesn't reorder fields

**Packing Example**:

**Unpacked Struct (3 slots)**:
```solidity
struct User {
    address wallet;      // Slot 0: 20 bytes (wastes 12)
    uint256 balance;     // Slot 1: 32 bytes
    bool isRegistered;   // Slot 2: 1 byte (wastes 31)
}
// Total: 96 bytes (3 slots) = 60,000 gas (cold)
```

**Packed Struct (2 slots)**:
```solidity
struct PackedData {
    uint128 smallNumber1;  // Slot 0: 16 bytes
    uint128 smallNumber2;  // Slot 0: 16 bytes (fits!)
    uint64 timestamp;      // Slot 1: 8 bytes
    address user;          // Slot 1: 20 bytes (fits!)
    bool flag;             // Slot 1: 1 byte (fits!)
}
// Total: 61 bytes (2 slots) = 40,000 gas (cold)
// Savings: 20,000 gas (50% reduction!)
```

**Real-World Impact**: In NFT contracts (Project 09), packing token metadata can save millions of gas when minting collections. In DeFi (Project 50), packing user positions saves significant gas across thousands of transactions.

**Foundation Building**: Struct packing is essential for:
- NFT metadata optimization (Project 09: ERC721 NFT)
- DeFi position tracking (Project 11: ERC4626, Project 50: DeFi Capstone)
- Gas optimization in production contracts (all projects)

### Events: The Bridge Between On-Chain and Off-Chain

**Computer Science Principle**: Events provide an efficient, searchable log of on-chain state changes, enabling off-chain systems (frontends, indexers) to track contract activity without expensive storage reads.

**How Events Work**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Contract emits event                    │
│   ↓                                      │
│ Event data stored in transaction log    │ ← Cheaper than storage!
│   ↓                                      │
│ Off-chain systems listen to events       │ ← Indexers, frontends
│   ↓                                      │
│ UI updates in real-time                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Events vs Storage**:

| Feature | Storage | Events |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Cost | ~20,000 gas/write | ~2,000 gas/emit |
| Persistence | Permanent | Permanent (in logs) |
| Searchability | No | Yes (indexed params) |
| Off-chain access | Requires RPC calls | Efficient filtering |
| Use case | On-chain state | Off-chain indexing |

**Indexed Parameters: The Search Feature**:

Indexed parameters are like searchable tags:
- Can filter events by indexed values
- Up to **3 indexed parameters** per event
- Each indexed param costs ~375 gas extra

**Example**:
```javascript
// Filter all NumberUpdated events where oldValue = 100
contract.on("NumberUpdated", { oldValue: 100 }, (event) => {
    console.log("Number was updated from 100!");
});
```

**Event Structure**:
```solidity
event NumberUpdated(uint256 indexed oldValue, uint256 indexed newValue);
//                            ↑ indexed              ↑ indexed
//                            (searchable)           (searchable)
```

**Gas Cost Breakdown**:
- Base event: ~375 gas
- Each indexed param: +375 gas
- Each non-indexed param: +375 gas (for data)
- **Total**: ~2,000-3,000 gas (much cheaper than storage!)

**Why Events Matter**: Frontends, indexers, and analytics tools all rely on events. Without events, off-chain systems would have to constantly poll storage (expensive and inefficient!). Events make blockchain data accessible to web applications.

**Foundation Building**: Events are critical for:
- Frontend integration (all projects)
- Transaction history tracking (Project 03: Events & Logging)
- DeFi protocols (Project 08: ERC20, Project 50: DeFi Capstone)
- NFT marketplaces (Project 09: ERC721 NFT)

### Constructors: One-Time Initialization

**Computer Science Principle**: Constructors execute exactly once during contract deployment, providing a deterministic initialization point that can't be re-executed.

**How Constructors Work**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Developer deploys contract             │
│   ↓                                      │
│ Constructor executes                   │ ← Runs ONCE, never again!
│   ↓                                      │
│ Initial state is set                    │
│   ↓                                      │
│ Contract is live on blockchain          │
│   ↓                                      │
│ Constructor code is DISCARDED           │ ← Not stored!
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Critical Insight**: Constructor code is **NOT stored on-chain**! Only the runtime code (your functions) is stored. The constructor runs during deployment, then disappears. This saves gas - you don't pay to store initialization code forever.

**Security Pattern: Setting Owner**:

Setting owner in constructor is a **CRITICAL security pattern**:
1. Establishes who controls the contract
2. `msg.sender` during deployment = the deployer
3. Prevents anyone else from claiming ownership
4. Common pattern in "Ownable" contracts (like OpenZeppelin)

**Gas Cost**:
- Constructor execution: Included in deployment cost
- Setting owner: ~20,000 gas (cold write)
- Setting isActive: ~20,000 gas (cold write)
- Total deployment: ~200,000+ gas (includes bytecode storage)

**Important**: Constructor can't be called again! Once deployed, there's NO WAY to re-run the constructor. This is why initialization must be complete and correct.

**Foundation Building**: Constructors are used for:
- Setting initial owners (Project 04: Modifiers & Restrictions)
- Initializing upgradeable proxies (Project 10: Upgradeability & Proxies)
- Setting up initial state in all contracts (all projects)

### Data Locations: Storage, Memory, and Calldata

**Computer Science Principle**: Understanding data locations is fundamental to gas optimization and preventing bugs. Each location has different costs, persistence, and mutability characteristics.

**The Three Realms of Solidity**:

| Location | Persistence | Cost | Mutability | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|------|------------|----------|
| **storage** | Permanent | ~20k/write, ~100/read | Mutable | State variables |
| **memory** | Temporary | ~3/word | Mutable | Local variables, return values |
| **calldata** | Read-only | Free (read from tx) | Immutable | External function parameters |

**Storage: The Permanent Vault**

Storage is like a bank vault - secure, permanent, but costly to access. State variables live here.

**Memory: The Temporary Workspace**

Memory is like a scratchpad - temporary and cheap:
- Allocated when function is called
- Erased when function exits
- Perfect for calculations and return values

**How Memory Works**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Function called                          │
│   ↓                                      │
│ Memory allocated (grows as needed)      │
│   ↓                                      │
│ Function executes (uses memory)         │
│   ↓                                      │
│ Function returns                         │
│   ↓                                      │
│ Memory cleared (freed automatically)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Memory Cost**: Each 32-byte word costs ~3 gas to allocate. An array of 10 uint256s costs ~30 gas for memory allocation. Compare that to storage: ~200,000 gas for 10 writes!

**Calldata: The Zero-Copy Champion**

Calldata is the MOST gas-efficient data location! It's read-only data that comes directly from the transaction.

**How Calldata Works**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ User sends transaction with data        │
│   ↓                                      │
│ Data stored in transaction calldata    │ ← Already on-chain!
│   ↓                                      │
│ Function reads directly from calldata   │ ← No copy needed!
│   ↓                                      │
│ Function returns                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Calldata Benefits**:
- Zero copy cost - reads directly from transaction
- Cheapest option for large arrays/strings
- Only available in EXTERNAL functions

**Gas Comparison (100-element array)**:

| Location | Allocation | Read First Element | Total |
|----------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| calldata | 0 gas | ~100 gas | **~100 gas** ← Winner! |
| memory | ~300 gas | ~103 gas | ~403 gas |
| storage | N/A | ~100 gas | ~100 gas |

**Restrictions**:
- Calldata only available in **EXTERNAL** functions
- Cannot be modified (read-only)
- Cannot be used in internal/public functions

**Foundation Building**: Data location understanding is critical for:
- Gas optimization (all projects)
- Function parameter design (Project 02: Functions & Payable)
- Preventing bugs (memory vs storage confusion causes many errors)
- External vs public functions (Project 08: ERC20, Project 09: ERC721)

## 🎓 How Concepts Build on Each Other

As you progress through this course, you'll see how the foundational concepts from this project form the building blocks for everything else:

1. **Type System → Security**: Strict types prevent vulnerabilities (Project 05: Errors & Reverts, Project 07: Reentrancy)
2. **Storage Layout → Gas Optimization**: Understanding slots enables optimization (Project 06: Mappings, Arrays & Gas)
3. **Mappings → Token Standards**: ERC20 balances are mappings (Project 08: ERC20 from Scratch)
4. **Events → Frontend Integration**: Events enable web3 apps (Project 03: Events & Logging)
5. **Data Locations → Efficiency**: Calldata optimization saves gas (Project 15: Low-Level Calls)
6. **Struct Packing → DeFi**: Efficient position tracking (Project 11: ERC4626, Project 50: DeFi Capstone)
7. **Constructors → Upgradeability**: Proxy patterns use initialization (Project 10: Upgradeability & Proxies)

**Each concept you master here makes you stronger for the next project!**

## 📋 Key Takeaways & Common Mistakes

### Essential Takeaways

1. **Types Are Strict**: EVM requires deterministic, fixed-size layout. No type inference, no dynamic typing - everything must be explicit.

2. **Data Locations Matter**: 
   - `storage`: Persistent, expensive (~20k gas/write)
   - `memory`: Temporary, medium cost (~3 gas/word)
   - `calldata`: Read-only, cheapest (no copy)

3. **Gas Is King**: Every operation costs gas. Storage is 100x more expensive than memory. Struct packing can save 50%+ gas.

4. **Mappings Are Special**: O(1) access, no iteration, infinite conceptual size. Storage slot = `keccak256(key, slot)`.

5. **Arrays Are Dangerous**: Unbounded growth → DoS risk. Iteration costs scale linearly. Consider mappings + events instead.

6. **Solidity ≠ Other Languages**: Static, explicit, gas-aware, blockchain-specific. Not like Python (dynamic) or Rust (with inference).

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Forgetting data location**: `uint[] arr` (missing `memory`/`calldata`)
- ❌ **Modifying memory instead of storage**: `User memory u = users[addr]; u.x = 5;` (doesn't affect storage!)
- ❌ **Inefficient packing**: Declaring `uint8` after `uint256` (wastes space)
- ❌ **Unbounded loops**: `for(i = 0; i < array.length; i++)` on large arrays (DoS risk)
- ❌ **Not checking array bounds explicitly** when needed
- ❌ **Using smaller uints for local variables** (costs MORE gas - use `uint256`)
- ❌ **Not emitting events** for state changes (off-chain indexing needs them)

## 🔧 What You'll Build

A contract demonstrating:
- All major Solidity datatypes (uint256, address, bool, bytes32, string)
- Storage vs memory vs calldata differences
- Gas-efficient struct packing
- Mapping usage patterns
- Array operations and costs
- Payable functions for ETH deposits

Plus:
- **Deployment script** using Foundry Scripts
- **Comprehensive test suite** with fuzz testing and gas benchmarking

## 📝 Tasks

### Task 1: Implement the Smart Contract

Open `src/DatatypesStorage.sol` and implement all the TODOs:

1. **State variables** for each datatype
2. **Functions** to manipulate mappings and arrays
3. **Getters** that demonstrate data location keywords
4. **Struct packing** to minimize gas costs
5. **Events** for important state changes

### Task 2: Create Your Deployment Script

Open `script/DeployDatatypesStorage.s.sol` and implement:

1. Read deployer's private key from environment using `vm.envOr()`
2. Start broadcasting transactions with `vm.startBroadcast()`
3. Deploy the contract using `new`
4. Log deployment information using `console.log()`
5. Stop broadcasting with `vm.stopBroadcast()`

**Why deployment scripts?** Reproducible, scriptable deployments that work the same way every time.

### Task 3: Write Your Test Suite

Open `test/DatatypesStorage.t.sol` and write comprehensive tests:

1. Constructor behavior and initial state
2. Value type operations (set/get)
3. Mapping operations (set, get, check existence)
4. Array operations (push, access, length, remove)
5. Struct operations (create, read, update)
6. Data location behavior (memory vs storage vs calldata)
7. Event emissions
8. Edge cases and error conditions
9. Fuzz testing with randomized inputs
10. Gas benchmarking

**Testing Best Practices**:
- Use descriptive test names: `test_FunctionName_Scenario`
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use `vm.expectRevert()` for error testing
- Use `vm.expectEmit()` for event testing
- Use `testFuzz_` prefix for fuzz tests

### Task 4: Study the Solutions

After implementing your own solutions, compare with:
- `src/solution/DatatypesStorageSolution.sol` - Reference contract implementation
- `script/solution/DeployDatatypesStorageSolution.s.sol` - Deployment script patterns
- `test/solution/DatatypesStorageSolution.t.sol` - Comprehensive test examples

**Important**: Try to implement everything yourself first! The solutions are there to help you learn, not to copy.

### Task 5: Compile and Test

```bash
cd 01-datatypes-and-storage

# Compile contracts
forge build

# Run all tests
forge test

# Run with verbose output
forge test -vvv

# Run with gas reporting
forge test --gas-report

# Run specific test
forge test --match-test test_SetNumber
```

### Task 6: Deploy Locally

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This project runs on LOCAL ANVIL ONLY**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Anvil (keep this running)
anvil

# Terminal 2: Deploy
cd 01-datatypes-and-storage

# Dry run (simulation only)
forge script script/DeployDatatypesStorage.s.sol

# Deploy to local Anvil (with transactions)
forge script script/DeployDatatypesStorage.s.sol \
  --broadcast \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

**Environment Setup**:

Create `.env` with Anvil's default accounts (see project files for examples). Use `PRIVATE_KEY` for main deployer, `PRIVATE_KEY_1` through `PRIVATE_KEY_9` for multi-address testing.

### Task 7: Experiment

Try these experiments:
1. Change `uint256` to `uint128` in a struct - how does gas change?
2. Modify struct packing order - measure the gas difference
3. Use `storage` instead of `memory` for an array parameter - what breaks?
4. Test with fuzz testing - what unexpected inputs break your code?
5. Compare gas costs: `forge snapshot` and `forge snapshot --diff`

## 🧪 Test Coverage

- ✅ Event emissions verification
- ✅ Edge cases (max values, empty arrays, zero address)
- ✅ Error conditions and reverts
- ✅ Fuzz testing with randomized inputs
- ✅ Gas benchmarking

## 🔍 Contract Walkthrough (Solution Highlights)

- **State layout**: `number`, `owner`, `isActive`, and `data` sit in consecutive slots to make the 32-byte alignment rules tangible. The `message` string shows how dynamic types spill into extra slots, while `balances` and `users` reuse the mapping slot math introduced earlier.
- **Events vs storage**: Every mutating function emits an event (e.g., `NumberUpdated`, `FundsDeposited`) to reinforce that history should live in logs while queryable state stays in storage (see Project 03).
- **Mappings & arrays**: `setBalance` uses direct assignment (no read-modify-write) when overwriting, while `addNumber`/`removeNumber` demonstrate the length write + element write pattern and the swap-and-pop gas saver (order not preserved).
- **Data locations**: `sumMemoryArray` vs `getFirstElement` contrast `memory` (cheap, copyable) and `calldata` (cheapest, zero-copy) so you can connect the theory from the “Data Locations” section to concrete syntax.
- **Structs**: `User` shows the simple “one slot per field” layout; `PackedData` shows how grouping small types reclaims a slot. `registerUser` writes directly to storage to avoid extra memory copies, while `getUser` copies to memory before returning multiple values.
- **Owner pattern**: The constructor sets `owner` once—seed for the access-control modifiers you’ll formalize in Project 04.

## ✅ Key Takeaways & Common Pitfalls

- Events are the cheap history channel; keep queryable state in storage and log context in events (don’t reverse it).
- Mapping keys that were never written return `0`—track existence separately if `0` is ambiguous.
- Dynamic types (`string`, `bytes`) cost multiple slots; prefer `bytes32` for fixed-size labels and use events for change history.
- Arrays grow via two writes (length + element); unbounded growth can DoS iteration—prefer mappings + events for scalable lists.
- Cache storage reads in memory before emitting events to avoid double `SLOAD`s.

## 🛰️ Real-World Analogies & Fun Facts

- **Elevator vs stairs**: Reading storage is like waiting for an elevator (slow but reaches every floor), while memory is taking the stairs for quick trips that don't persist.
- **DAO fork**: After the 2016 DAO exploit, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split. That fork reinforced the need for explicit storage rules because replaying history on two chains demanded byte-for-byte determinism.
- **ETH inflation risk**: Large unbounded mappings/arrays increase state size. More state means more chain bloat; if block sizes grow, validators need more resources, which can indirectly pressure issuance to pay for security.
- **Compiler trivia**: The Solidity team ships frequent optimizer improvements; a packed struct can compile down to fewer `SSTORE` opcodes, saving thousands of gas. Run `solc --optimize` to see the difference in bytecode size.
- **Layer 2 tie-in**: Rollups charge mainly for calldata. Returning `bytes32` instead of `string` trims calldata bytes, which can cut fees by 30–60% on optimistic rollups.
- **Deployment automation**: Most production teams use Foundry Scripts or Hardhat scripts to deploy. This ensures consistency and allows for automated verification, which is critical for security audits.
- **Testing importance**: Every major Ethereum hack (DAO, Parity, etc.) could have been prevented with better testing. Writing comprehensive tests is not optional - it's essential.
- **Creator trivia**: Solidity was co-designed by Gavin Wood and Christian Reitwiessner; they favored explicit types so compilers (Solc) could map human code to tight EVM bytecode without ambiguity.
