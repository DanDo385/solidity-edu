## 🔑 Key Concepts

### What is ERC-4626?

ERC-4626 is a standard for tokenized vaults that:
- Represent shares of an underlying asset (like USDC, DAI, WETH)
- Enable yield-generating strategies
- Provide standardized deposit/withdraw interfaces
- Power DeFi protocols like Yearn, Beefy, and Rari

### Real-World Use Cases

- **Yield Aggregators**: Yearn vaults deposit user funds into highest-yield protocols
- **Lending**: Aave/Compound style interest-bearing tokens
- **Liquidity Mining**: Auto-compounding LP rewards
- **Treasury Management**: Protocol-owned liquidity strategies

## 🧮 Core Concepts

### Asset vs Shares: Understanding the Exchange Rate

**FIRST PRINCIPLES: Fractional Reserve Banking**

ERC-4626 vaults work like banks - you deposit assets and receive shares that represent your portion of the vault.

**CONNECTION TO PROJECT 08**:
- **Project 08**: ERC20 tokens (fungible)
- **Project 11**: ERC-4626 vaults (also ERC20 tokens, but representing shares!)
- Vault shares ARE ERC20 tokens - they're fungible tokens representing fractional ownership!

**UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT**:

```solidity
// User deposits 100 USDC (asset)
// Vault mints 95 shares (based on current exchange rate)
// Later: shares are worth more USDC due to yield

asset = underlying token (USDC, WETH, etc.)  // What you deposit
shares = vault tokens (yUSDC, vWETH, etc.)   // What you receive
```

**HOW IT WORKS**:

```
Vault Mechanics:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Initial State:                          │
│   totalAssets = 1000 USDC               │
│   totalSupply = 1000 shares             │
│   Exchange rate: 1 share = 1 USDC      │
│   ↓                                      │
│ User deposits 100 USDC:                 │
│   shares = (100 * 1000) / 1000 = 100   │ ← Mint 100 shares
│   ↓                                      │
│ Vault earns yield:                      │
│   totalAssets = 1100 USDC (10% yield)   │
│   totalSupply = 1100 shares             │
│   Exchange rate: 1 share = 1 USDC      │ ← Still 1:1!
│   ↓                                      │
│ User withdraws 100 shares:             │
│   assets = (100 * 1100) / 1100 = 100   │ ← But vault has 1100 USDC!
│   User gets: 100 USDC                   │ ← Original deposit
│   Vault keeps: 10 USDC yield            │ ← Profit!
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**SHARE CALCULATION** (Precision Math):

```solidity
// Deposit: shares = assets * totalSupply / totalAssets
shares = (assets * totalSupply) / totalAssets;

// Withdraw: assets = shares * totalAssets / totalSupply  
assets = (shares * totalAssets) / totalSupply;
```

**UNDERSTANDING ROUNDING** (Critical for Security):

**Always Round DOWN** (favor vault):
```solidity
// ✅ CORRECT: Round down (favor vault)
shares = (assets * totalSupply) / totalAssets;  // Integer division rounds down

// ❌ WRONG: Round up (favor attacker)
shares = (assets * totalSupply + totalAssets - 1) / totalAssets;  // Rounds up!
```

**Why Round Down?**
- Prevents inflation attacks
- Ensures vault always has enough assets
- Protects against precision manipulation

**GAS COST BREAKDOWN** (from Project 01 & 06 knowledge):

**Deposit**:
- ERC20 transfer: ~50,000 gas (approve + transferFrom)
- Share calculation: ~100 gas (MUL + DIV)
- Mint shares: ~20,000 gas (SSTORE)
- Event: ~2,000 gas
- Total: ~72,100 gas

**Withdraw**:
- Share calculation: ~100 gas
- Burn shares: ~5,000 gas (SSTORE to zero)
- ERC20 transfer: ~50,000 gas
- Event: ~2,000 gas
- Total: ~57,100 gas

**REAL-WORLD ANALOGY**: 
Like buying shares of a mutual fund:
- **Assets** = Cash you deposit (USDC)
- **Shares** = Fund shares you receive
- **Exchange Rate** = NAV (Net Asset Value)
- **Yield** = Fund performance increases NAV

## 🔧 What You'll Build

A complete ERC-4626 vault that:
- Accepts an ERC-20 asset (like USDC)
- Issues share tokens representing ownership
- Implements all required ERC-4626 functions
- Handles rounding correctly (favor vault on deposits/withdraws)
- Includes security checks and reentrancy guards
- Demonstrates yield accrual simulation

## 📝 Tasks

### Task 1: Implement the Skeleton Contract

Open `src/ERC4626Vault.sol` and implement:

1. **Asset management** - deposit, withdraw, totalAssets
2. **Share conversion** - convertToShares, convertToAssets
3. **Preview functions** - simulate operations
4. **Max functions** - return maximum allowed amounts
5. **ERC-20 share tokens** - inherit or implement

### Task 2: Study the Solution

Compare with `src/solution/ERC4626VaultSolution.sol`:
- Understand share/asset conversion math
- See rounding direction choices (favor vault)
- Learn security patterns (reentrancy, donation attacks)
- Study real-world vault patterns

### Task 3: Run Comprehensive Tests

```bash
cd 11-ERC4626-tokenized-vault

# Run all tests
forge test -vvv

# Test specific scenarios
forge test --match-test test_Deposit
forge test --match-test test_Withdraw
forge test --match-test test_ShareConversion

# Gas report
forge test --gas-report

# Coverage
forge coverage
```

### Task 4: Deploy and Interact

```bash
# Start local node
anvil

# Deploy vault (in another terminal)
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url http://localhost:8545

# Interact with vault
cast call <VAULT_ADDRESS> "totalAssets()(uint256)"
cast send <VAULT_ADDRESS> "deposit(uint256,address)(uint256)" 1000000 <YOUR_ADDRESS> \
  --private-key <KEY>
```

### Task 5: Study Real Implementations

After completing this project, study production vaults:
- [OpenZeppelin ERC4626](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol)
- [Solmate ERC4626](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC4626.sol)
- [Yearn vaults](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults)

## 🧪 Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- ✅ Deposit and mint operations
- ✅ Withdraw and redeem operations
- ✅ Share/asset conversion accuracy
- ✅ Preview function correctness
- ✅ Max function constraints
- ✅ Rounding behavior (favor vault)
- ✅ Edge cases (first depositor, zero amounts)
- ✅ Attack vectors (inflation attack, donation attack)
- ✅ Yield accrual simulation
- ✅ Gas optimization

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

### 1. Inflation Attack

**Problem**: First depositor can manipulate share price

```solidity
// Attacker deposits 1 wei, gets 1 share
vault.deposit(1, attacker);

// Attacker donates large amount directly to vault
asset.transfer(address(vault), 1000000e18);

// Now 1 share = 1000000e18 assets
// Victim deposits 999999e18, gets 0 shares (rounded down!)
```

**Solution**: Mint dead shares to address(0) on first deposit, or require minimum deposit.

### 2. Donation Attack

**Problem**: Direct transfers can break accounting

**Solution**: Don't rely on `asset.balanceOf(address(this))`, track deposits internally.

### 3. Rounding Direction

**Always favor the vault**:
- Deposit/mint: round DOWN shares given to user
- Withdraw/redeem: round UP shares taken from user

### 4. Reentrancy

Use OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard on deposit/withdraw functions.

## 📊 Comparison: Vault Implementations

| Implementation | Gas Cost | Security | Flexibility |

| Solmate | Lower (optimized) | ✅✅ | High |
| This Project | Educational | ✅✅✅ | Learning |

## 🌍 Real-World Examples

### Yearn Finance

```solidity
// Yearn vault accepts USDC, implements yield strategy
yUSDC vault = YearnVault(vaultAddress);
vault.deposit(1000e6, msg.sender);  // Deposit 1000 USDC
// Vault deploys to Aave, Compound, Curve for best yield
```

### Beefy Finance

```solidity
// Auto-compounding LP token vault
BeefyVault mooToken = BeefyVault(vaultAddress);
mooToken.deposit(lpTokenAmount, msg.sender);
// Vault claims rewards, sells, re-invests into LP
```
